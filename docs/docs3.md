## docs3

I'm creating this new file to see if it's pushed to SUMMARY.md automatically from here as I merge this commit.

Another unrelated change

whatever

this time I'm also doing a change to the page I added the MD comments

***

## Creating a header

Linking to that [header](./#creating-a-header) the way Hervé mentioned

[Linking](docs3.md#creating-a-header) the way I think should work

### Creating an H2 header

Linking to the [H2 Header](creating-an-h2-header/) the way Hervé mentioned

[Linking](docs3.md#creating-an-h2-header) the way I think should work



Now I'm [linking through the GitBook editor](docs3.md#creating-a-header) to the H1

[Linking with the GitBook editor](docs3.md#creating-an-h2-header) to the H2
